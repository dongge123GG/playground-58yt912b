# Welcome!

This C++ template lets you get started quickly with a simple one-page playground.

```C++ runnable
#include <iostream>
int main(){
    std::cout<<"你好吊毛"<<std::endl
}
# Advanced usage

If you want a more complex example (external libraries, viewers...), use the [Advanced C++ template](https://tech.io/select-repo/598)
